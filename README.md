# AI-PERSONAL-FITNESS-TRACKER

## Description

This project develops a Python-based personal fitness tracker that enhances calorie expenditure estimations by incorporating critical physiological data. It moves beyond traditional fitness trackers by integrating heart rate, body temperature, age, and weight, alongside standard activity details. Leveraging established formulas and models from exercise physiology, this application provides more accurate and personalized insights into fitness progress.

## Why This Project Is Useful

Traditional fitness trackers often rely on generalized formulas, leading to inaccurate calorie estimations and limited personalization. This project addresses these limitations by:

* **Improved Accuracy:** Integrating physiological data for more precise calorie expenditure calculations.
* **Personalized Insights:** Providing comparative analysis against demographic averages, allowing users to contextualize their fitness progress.
* **Data-Driven Approach:** Empowering users to make informed decisions about their fitness routines based on accurate and personalized data.
* **Foundation for Advanced Features:** Serving as a modular foundation for future enhancements, including GUI development and real-time data integration.

## Features

* **Physiological Data Input:** Records heart rate, body temperature, age, and weight alongside activity details.
* **Accurate Calorie Estimation:** Utilizes established exercise physiology formulas for precise calculations.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Compares user data to demographic averages for contextualized insights.
* **Console-Based Interface:** Simple and efficient command-line interaction.
* **Structured Data Storage:** Supports future data analysis and expansion.
